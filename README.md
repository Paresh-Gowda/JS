# ðŸ§  JavaScript Learning Journey

This project is a complete documentation of my JavaScript learning journey, organized into 8 chapters. 
Each chapter covers key concepts such as variables, data types, functions, loops, arrays, conditionals, DOM manipulation, and localStorage. 
The purpose of this structure was to learn JavaScript step-by-step while building real, working examples along the way.

As a way to apply what I learned, I created three mini projects using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
These projects helped me connect theory to practice through hands-on coding.

The first project is a **To-Do List**, where users can add and delete tasks with due dates. 
It uses dynamic DOM updates and basic array operations. 
The second is a **Cricket Game**, a fun bat-ball-stump game where the player competes against the computer, with score tracking using localStorage.
The third is a simple **Calculator**, performing basic arithmetic operations in a clean browser interface.

These mini projects reflect my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and how they can be used to build interactive browser-based applications.
